<p>This page represents some web content such as an article, a blog post, or any other resource with a URL. It can be a
    either a static resource or a place within a dynamic web app.</p>

<p>Inside the page we wish to embed a discussion forum so users can post their reactions, feedback, etc. That is where
    Speakur comes in. It provides an easily embeddable discussion forum by providing a custom HTML tag that can be
    inserted anywhere in the page.</p>

<div>
    <p>
        Here's an example of how it works:
    </p>

    <UL>
        <li>You have a blog or website.</li>
        <li>You create a Firebase app to host the comment data.</li>
        <li>You add speakur-discussion and its dependencies to your <code>bower_components</code> directory.</li>
        <Li>You add the <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code> element to your page where you want it to show up, and
            point the element at your Firebase URL.
        </Li>
        <li>You now have a full-featured commenting system on your site!</li>
    </UL>
</div>

<div style="">
    <p>
        For example, here's a <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code> for this demo page:
    </p>

    <pre>
        &lt;speakur-discussion
            firebaseLocation="https://speakur-demo.firebaseio.com"
            xtitle="Demonstration Thread for &lt;Speakur-Discussion&gt;"
            allowAnonymous="false"
            initiallyOpen="true"&gt;
        &lt;/speakur-discussion&gt;
    </pre>
    <P>Which results in this:</P>


    <!--firebaseLocation="https://speakur-demo.firebaseio.com"-->
    <!--theme="speakur-theme-red" initiallyOpen="false"-->
    <speakur-discussion
        firebaseLocation="https://speakur-demo.firebaseio.com"
        xtitle="Demonstration Thread for <Speakur-Discussion>"
        allowAnonymous="false"
        initiallyOpen="true">
    </speakur-discussion>
</div>

<p>
    This last part belongs to the containing page. This could be your page footer.
</p>
<hr>

<P>The main part of the page uses a different font than the Speakur component mainly to test that Speakur is largely independent of the page
    style &ndash;
    except for the overall transparent background. You can also style the <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code>
    element with a background.</P>
