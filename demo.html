<p>An example of using <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code>:</p>

<p>This page represents some web content such as an article, a blog post, or any other resource with a URL. It can be a
    either a static resource or a place within a dynamic web app.</p>

<p>Inside the page we wish to embed a discussion forum so users can post their reactions, feedback, etc. That is where
    Speakur comes in. It provides an easily embeddable discussion forum by providing a custom HTML tag that can be
    inserted anywhere in the page.</p>

<div>
    Here's an example of how it works:
</div>

<div style="margin: 20px;">
    <speakur-discussion theme="dark" initiallyOpen="true">
        Your custom footer goes here
    </speakur-discussion>
</div>

<p>
    This part belongs to the containing page.
