It can be a either a static resource or a place within a dynamic web app.</p><p>Inside the page we wish to embed a discussion forum so users can post their reactions, feedback, etc. That is where Speakur comes in. It provides an easily embeddable discussion forum by providing a custom HTML tag that can be inserted anywhere in the page.</p><div><p>Here's an example of how it works:</p><ul><li>You have a blog or website.</li><li>You create a Firebase app to host the comment data.</li><li>You add speakur-discussion and its dependencies to your <code>bower_components</code> directory.</li><li>You add the <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code> element to your page where you want it to show up, and point the element at your Firebase URL.</li><li>You now have a full-featured commenting system on your site!</li></ul></div><div style><p>For example, here's a <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code> for this demo page:</p><pre>
        &lt;speakur-discussion
            firebaseLocation="https://speakur-demo.firebaseio.com"
            xtitle="Demonstration Thread for &lt;Speakur-Discussion&gt;"
            allowAnonymous="false"
            initiallyOpen="true"&gt;
        &lt;/speakur-discussion&gt;
    </pre><p>Which results in this:</p><speakur-discussion firebaselocation="https://speakur-demo.firebaseio.com" xtitle="Demonstration Thread for <Speakur-Discussion>" href="demo1" allowanonymous="true" initiallyopen="true"></speakur-discussion></div><p>This last part belongs to the containing page. This could be your page footer.</p><hr><p>The main part of the page uses a different font than the Speakur component mainly to test that Speakur is largely independent of the page style &ndash; except for the overall transparent background. You can also style the <code>&lt;speakur-discussion&gt;</code> element with a background.</p></body></html>
